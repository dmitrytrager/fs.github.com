The flow of the task in Trello is as follows
============================================

To-Do
-----

We start tasks from To-Do, where tasks sorted in terms of priority. The first one – the most important

WIP
---

Once a developer started working on a task, he moves it to WIP

Review
------

Once developer completed a task, he moves a card to ‘Review’. It means that task has been completed and is ready for internal code review

QA
--

Once task has been reviewed, deployed to staging and is ready to be tested by the client it’s being moved to ‘QA’ board

Done
----

Once client have tested a task and is happy with it, it's being moved to ‘Done’ board. If it needs more work, it's being moved to ‘WIP’.
